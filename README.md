This project has the goal to develop the official Corona-Warn-App for Germany based on the Exposure Notification API by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/).  The apps (for both iOS and Android) will collect anonymous data from nearby mobile phones using Bluetooth technology. The data will be stored locally on each device, preventing authorities’ access and control over tracing data. This repository contains the **implementation of the key server** for the Corona-Warn-App. This implementation is **work in progress** and contains alpha-quality code only.

## Service APIs

Service      | OpenAPI Specification
-------------|-------------
Submission Service        | https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-server/raw/master/services/submission/api_v1.json
Distribution Service      | https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-server/raw/master/services/distribution/api_v1.json


## Development

### Setup

To setup this project locally on your machine, we recommend to install the following prerequisites:
  - Java OpenJDK 11
  - Maven 3.6
  - Docker if you would like to build Docker images
  - Postgres if you would like to connect a persistent storage. If no postgres connection is specified an in-memory HSQLDB will be provided.

### Build

After you checked out the repository run ```mvn install``` in your base directory to build the project.

### Run

Navigate to the service you would like to start and run the spring-boot:run target. By default the HSQLDB will be used and after the Spring Boot application started the endpoint will be available on your local port 8080. As an example if you would like to start the submission service run:
```
  cd services/submission/
  mvn spring-boot:run
```

If you want to use a postgres DB instead please use the postgres profile when starting the application:

```
  cd services/submission/
  mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=postgres
```

In order to enable S3 integration, you will need the following vars in your env:

Var | Description
----|----------------
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | The access key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | The secret access key
cwa.objectstore.endpoint | The S3 endpoint
cwa.objectstore.bucket | The S3 bucket name

### Build and run Docker Compose (full stack)
To start:
- Run `docker-compose up`
- After the initial build and startup, an initial "distribution" will run

To start additional "distribution" runs:
- Run `docker-compose start distribution`

### Build and run single Docker Images

First download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

If you want to build and run a docker image of a service you can use the prepared script in the respective service directory.
To build and run the distribution service:
```
./services/distribution/build_and_run.sh
```

To build and run the submission service:
```
./services/submission/build_and_run.sh
```
The submission service will then be available locally on port 8080.

## Debugging 

You may run the application with the spring profile `dev` to enable the `DEBUG` log-level.

```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=postgres,dev
```

To be able to set breakpoints (e.g. in IntelliJ), it may be necessary to use the parameter `-Dspring-boot.run.fork=false`. 


## Known Issues

There are no known issues.

## Contributors

The German government has asked SAP and Deutsche Telekom to develop the Corona-Warn-App. Deutsche Telekom is providing the infrastructure technology and will operate and run the backend for the app in a safe, scalable, and stable manner. SAP is responsible for the development of the app development and the exposure notification backend. Therefore, development teams of SAP and T-Systems are contributing to this project. At the same time, our commitment to open source means that we are enabling -and encouraging- all interested parties to contribute and become part of its developer community.
