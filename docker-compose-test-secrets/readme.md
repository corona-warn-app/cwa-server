About the secrets contained here for development and testing
=============================================================

These files have been generated by the ../scripts/generate_keys.sh script. If you need to regenerate them, please use and maintain that script.

Note that since this is a testing scenario, we have keys for both sides of the encryption (CWA-Backend  _and_  EFGS). In reality, we would receive only a public key from EFGS to use for checking their request.

CWA-Backend (in prod maintained by TSI)
---------------------------------------

- `private.pem`: The secret used to generate all key material on CWA-Backend side.
- `certificate.crt`: The x509 certificate generated from the `private.pem` key.
- `ssl.p12`: The SSL certificate on CWA-Backend side.

EFGS (in prod maintained by EFGS, TSI receives only public keys)
----------------------------------------------------------------

- `efgs_signing_key.pem`: The secret used to generate all key material on EFGS side.
- `efgs_signing_cert.pem`: EFGS signing certificate for EFGS batch signing.
- `efgs.p12`: The EFGS PFX file that e.g. can also be used in a Postman request to fake being EFGS.
- `contains_efgs_truststore.jks`: The Java truststore that is used on the server side, containing the `efgs.p12` file to verify that we are communicating with a trusted client. Therefore the `efgs.p12` needs to be used when sending a request.
