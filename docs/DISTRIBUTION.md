# CWA-Server Distribution Service

The distribution service's objective is to publish all CWA-related files to the object store, from which
the clients will fetch their data. There are three types of files.

## Key Export

Key Export files are files, which hold published diagnosis keys from users that have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
These files are based on the specification of Google/Apple and are generated in regular intervals.
Each interval generates a `.zip` file for each applicable country where keys are known. Each `.zip file` contains two files:

1. export.bin: Contains the list of diagnosis keys.
2. export.sig: Contains signature information needed for validating the export.bin file.
The file structure definition can be found [here](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-server/blob/HEAD/internal/pb/export/export.proto).

The distribution service is triggered by a CRON scheduler, currently set to 1 hour. However, this
will change, since the Exposure Notification APIs have a rate-limiting in place (cf. details for [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/exposurenotification/enmanager/3586331-detectexposures) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/exposure-notifications-api#providediagnosiskeys)).

In case there is an insufficient number of diagnosis keys for the target interval available, the
creation of the file will be skipped in order to prevent attackers from being potentially able to
de-obfuscate individuals.

Another alternative is to put fake diagnosis keys into the payload, which would serve the same purpose.
In that case, it needs to be guaranteed, that those fake diagnosis keys are indistinguishable from real ones.

## Configuration

Configuration files are needed for two use cases:

1. Exposure Configuration: In order to calculate a risk score for each exposure incident, the mobile
API requires a list of the following parameters, requiring weights and levels: duration, days, attenuation and transmission.
The function and impact of those parameters is described on the [Apple Exposure Configuration Page](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/exposurenotification/enexposureconfiguration) and in the chapter [*Risk score calculation*](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/HEAD/solution_architecture.md#risk-score-calculation) of the solution architecture document.
2. Mobile App Configuration: Provides configuration values needed for the CWA mobile app, which are
not part of the exposure notification framework. These values are required for controlling the
application behavior.

## Discovery

Files on CWA may be discovered with the help of index files. There is one central index file,
containing all available key export files on the server, separated by new-line.
The index will be regenerated whenever new export files are distributed to the object store.

## Data Retention

The retention period is set to 14 days. Therefore, all diagnosis keys and trace time warnings whose _submission date_ is older than 14 days are removed from the system. This includes the database persistence layer, as well as files stored on the object store.
The retention mechanism is enforced automatically by the Distribution Service upon each distribution run (multiple runs per day). The retention trigger by distribution will also be reflected within the keys pending upload to the
federation gateway. This is especially important in scenarios where the upload service may not of run for some time or there are some failures to ensure invalid keys are not accidentally propagated.
No manual trigger or action is required.

Data is deleted by normal means. For PostgreSQL, the identified rows will be deleted by normal __DELETE__ calls to the database, and
cleaned up when auto vacuuming is executed.

When data deletion is executed on the object store, the object store is instructed to delete all files with the following prefixes:

`version/v1/diagnosis-keys/country/<country_code>/date/<date>`

- In which `<date>` stands for the ISO formatted date (e.g. `2012-06-05`), and is before the retention cutoff date (today - 14 days).

`version/v1/twp/country/<country_code>/hour/<hour>`

- In which `<hour>` stands for the hour since Unix epoch, and is before the retention cutoff date (today - 14 days).

## Spring Profiles

Spring profiles are used to apply distribution service configuration based on the running environment, determined by the active profile.

You will find `.yaml` and `.xml` based profile-specific configuration files at [`/services/distribution/src/main/resources`](/services/distribution/src/main/resources).

### Available Profiles

Profile                       | Effect
------------------------------|-------------
`debug`                         | Sets the log level to `DEBUG` and changes the `CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN` used by Log4j 2.
`cloud`                       | Removes default values for the `spring.flyway`, `spring.datasource` and `services.distribution.objectstore` configurations. <br>Changes the distribution output path and turns off `set-public-read-acl-on-put-object`.
`demo`                        | Includes incomplete days and hours into the distribution run, thus creating aggregates for the current day and the current hour (and including both in the respective indices). When running multiple distributions in one hour with this profile, the date aggregate for today and the hours aggregate for the current hour will be updated and overwritten. This profile also turns off the expiry policy (Keys must be expired for at least 2 hours before distribution) and the shifting policy (there must be at least 140 keys in a distribution).
`testdata`                    | Causes test data to be inserted into the database before each distribution run. By default, around 1000 random diagnosis keys will be generated per hour. If there are no diagnosis keys in the database yet, random keys will be generated for every hour from the beginning of the retention period (14 days ago at 00:00 UTC) until one hour before the present hour. If there are already keys in the database, the random keys will be generated for every hour from the latest diagnosis key in the database (by submission timestamp) until one hour before the present hour (or none at all, if the latest diagnosis key in the database was submitted one hour ago or later).
`signature-dev`               | Sets the app package ID in the export packages' signature info to `de.rki.coronawarnapp-dev` so that the non-productive/test public key will be used for client-side validation.
`signature-prod`              | Sets the app package ID in the export packages' signature info to `de.rki.coronawarnapp` so that the productive public key will be used for client-side validation.
`disable-ssl-client-postgres` | Disables SSL for the connection to the postgres database.

Please refer to the section [Configuration Properties](#configuration-properties) and the inline comments in the base `application.yaml` configuration file for further details on the configuration properties impacted by the above profiles.

## Configuration Properties

All of the configurable parameters, that are used throughout this service can be found in the
[`application.yaml`](/services/distribution/src/main/resources/application.yaml) file. This configuration file is
divided into different sub-categories:

- Some general configuration, which isn't divided into sub-categories
- `paths` - Local paths, that are used during the export creation
- `tek-export` - Configuration for the exported archive, that is saved on the S3-compatible storage
- `api` - API configuration, configures the API, which is used by the mobile app to query diagnosis keys
- `signature` - Signature configuration, used for signing the exports
- `objectstore` - Configuration for the S3 compatible object storage
- `app-features` - [Configuration for mobile clients](#app-features)

## Object Store

The communication with the S3 compatible object storage, that is hosted by Deutsche Telekom is achieved through AWS SDK
v2. The files, that will be uploaded to the S3 compatible storage are created on local storage first (output path
defined in application configuration) and are then uploaded to the storage provider.

### Headers

Up to three headers are set during upload, depending on the configuration properties.

#### `Cache-Control`

Defines the maximum amount of time a published resource is considered fresh, when held in cache. Will be set for each
upload. The default value is 300 seconds.

#### `x-amz-acl`

Defines the canned ACL for the uploaded file. Is only set if [`set-public-read-acl-on-put-object`] is set to true in the
configuration properties. Will be `public-read` in that case, which grants full control to the owners and read-access to
AllUsers. This setting should only be used when running with the application with the local Zenko Cloudserver.

#### `cwa-hash`

Custom header, which adds a complex MD5 hash of the archive contents (export.bin). If the file isn't an archive, the
contents of the file will be used to build the hash (index files). This header is used to determine whether a file
should be uploaded or not. If the hash for the file is the same as the hash available on the S3 compatible storage it
will not be uploaded, since the contents of that specific file did not change, so there is no need to re-upload the
file. If the hash differs, or the file is not available on the S3 compatible storage, the file will be uploaded.

This header is needed, since it is not possible to create byte-identical archives when using ECDSA due to its
non-deterministic nature.

To calculate the CWA-hash locally, e.g. on a Mac you can use the following code in a terminal on the archive contents:

```sh
md5 -q export.bin | tr a-z A-Z | xxd -p -r | md5 -q
```

#### `ETag`

[Standard HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag), used to determine whether the
archive has changed and needs to be re-uploaded or re-downloaded by clients (i.e. mobile apps). Usually an MD5 of the
complete archive file, but can be complex to calculate for multi-part uploads (i.e. see [this answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12186993/what-is-the-algorithm-to-compute-the-amazon-s3-etag-for-a-file-larger-than-5gb#answer-19896823).

## Threading

The upload operations are being run in multiple threads in order to increase performance. The number of threads is
defined in the application configuration. Each upload operation is passed to Spring Boot's `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor`,
which then distributes them across the available threads. Once all tasks are submitted, the logic checks, whether all
threads have terminated before shutting down the thread pool. If errors are thrown, they are handled as explained in the
following section.

## Error Handling

In order to increase resilience of the distribution service two error handling measures were introduced.

The first one being Spring Boot's Retry logic, which is applied to all S3 operations with the number of retries being
specified in the application configuration. This results in Spring Boot retrying the operation up to three times, with a
two second pause in between.

The second part will catch operations, that have failed even after retrying them through SpringBoot's Retry logic. If
more than five uploads fail (can be configured in the application configuration) the program will terminate with an
error, if less than five operations have failed so far the error will just be logged to console, but the upload will
continue.

The error handling is designed to handle intermediate errors, like short connection problems. If too many operations
fail it is safe to assume, that a bigger problem is occurring and that subsequent operations will also fail. In this
case the program is terminated to prevent unnecessary load.

## Retention

The same 14 days retention period (like the database) is also enforced on the S3 compatible storage. Each distribution
run will execute the retention policy.

When data deletion is executed on the object store, the object store is instructed to delete all files with the following
prefixes:

`version/v1/diagnosis-keys/country/<country_code>/date/<date>`

- In which `<date>` stands for the ISO formatted date (e.g. `2012-06-05`), and is before the retention cutoff date (today - 14 days).

`version/v1/twp/country/<country_code>/hour/<hour>`

- In which `<hour>` stands for the hour since Unix epoch, and is before the retention cutoff date (today - 14 days).

## Assembly Process

The exported diagnosis-keys are being organized in hourly and daily archives. The folder structure is as follows:
`/version/<version>/diagnosis-keys/country/<ISO-3166-country>/date/<YYYY-MM-DD>/hour/<hh>/index`. The version, country,
date and hour directory also contain an index file each, listing all the sub-directories. All generated files are named
`index`, which acts as a workaround to also support files & folders with the same name - e.g.
`version/v1/diagnosis-keys/country` is both a file and the folder `version/v1/diagnosis-keys/country/`. S3 supports this
concept, but writing this structure to the local disk is not supported. Therefore, this country file will be assembled as
`version/v1/diagnosis-keys/country/index`. The `/index` part will then be removed upon S3 upload.

The `origin_country` (ISO-3166 country code) parameter refers to the country in which the CWA clients and backend operate.
It is used to create a folder on the CDN distribution paths, where so called "national key packages" are distributed.
In essence, these packages contain keys submitted by CWA clients as well as keys from visitors of the country, that
have been downloaded from the Federation Gateway Service.
Furthermore,based on the parameter`eu-package-name` an additional folder will be created which provides all keys from
the supported countries in a single package.

For each assembly run the diagnosis keys for the last 14 days are queried. Based on the result, hour and their parent
directories are created and the keys are added to their respective archives. To which archive the key should be added is
determined by the distribution timestamp.

The diagnosis keys need to be expired for at least two hours, before they can be distributed. This means that if the key
has been submitted within two hours after the expire date, it cannot be published immediately. Therefore a distribution
timestamp is calculated, which is either the submission timestamp, or, if the submission timestamp is within two hours
after the expire date, the expire date plus two hours. This ensures compliance with the specification from Google and
Apple.

Each run creates all hourly and daily archives for the last 14 days. To prevent unnecessary uploads the
[`cwa-hash`](#cwa-hash) header has been introduced.

## Diagnosis Key Export Files

At the end of the process the diagnosis keys are exported into ZIP archives that contain two entries:

- export.bin - the binary containing the exposure keys
- export.sig - the signature to verify the export binary

The `export.bin` file of the archive contains the Temporary Exposure Keys that are uploaded from the devices of the
people who are diagnosed with COVID-19.
The `export.sig` file is used by the server to sign each `export.bin` with a private key. The `export.sig` file
contains the raw signature as well as additional information needed for verification.

## Signing

The signing of the files basically means creating and signing an archive that contain the `export.bin` file
(the file name is configurable in `application.yaml` under `tek-export.file-name` property).
Both the application configuration as well as the Temporary Exposure Keys are signed so that the mobile devices
can verify if the files are originating from the right backend. Using the signature, attack vectors like a
man in the middle attack, request forgery etc. can be mitigated successfully. The implementation is done in
[`DistributionArchiveSigningDecorator`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/assembly/structure/archive/decorator/signing/).

The signing process takes the `export.bin` archive and creates a signature of the data structure which is then written into the `export.sig`.
Please see `getSignatureFile` method located in [`SigningDecoratorOnDisk`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/assembly/structure/archive/decorator/signing/SigningDecoratorOnDisk.java).

The algorithm used for signing the archives as well as other relevant information is defined in the [`application.yaml`](/services/distribution/src/main/resources/application.yaml).

## Bundling and Shifting

The [`DiagnosisKeyBundler`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/assembly/diagnosiskeys/DiagnosisKeyBundler.java)
is responsible for the core logic of the distribution service, e.g. how the diagnosis keys are grouped into date and
hour folders on the CDN.

In the preparation step, the distribution job queries all diagnosis keys that are available in the database and
caches them into the `DiagnosisKeyBundler`. The purpose of this class is to arrange keys based on their earliest time
(date and hour) of distribution, and provide this information to the components which create the archives.
There are two implementations of the key bundler, loaded based on the active profile.
It is noteworthy to mention that the productive diagnosis key bundler applies a series of policies on the keys originating
from the country specified by the parameter`origin-country`, which is defined in the [`application.yaml`](/services/distribution/src/main/resources/application.yaml).
Furthermore, with the parameter `apply-policies-for-all-countries` it is possible to apply the policies to all keys.

Policies are as follows:

- As described in the GAEN framework (more details [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/exposurenotification/setting_up_a_key_server)),
diagnosis keys must not be distributed before two hours after the end of the key's expiration window(calculated by
adding the rolling period of the key to its start interval number).
- The shifting policy. Which ensures that each distribution/export file published to the CDN. contains at least
140 Temporary Exposure Keys (configurable by the `shifting-policy-threshold` property). Where there are less
keys available to distribute in a specific distribution run, these keys are shifted to a succeeding export,
until the threshold minimum is fulfilled.

## Digital Green Certificate

A Digital Green Certificate is a digital proof that a person has either been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result or recovered from COVID-19.
The data is provided by DCC Rule & Value Set Distribution Backend and consumed through a feign client build in cwa-server.
The CWA Server serves as a proxy to obtain rules and value sets from the data source, apply necessary transformation, sign the data, and publish it on CDN.

The consumed data is divided in two parts:

- `value sets` - Contains the possible values for entities involved in the Digital Green Certificate process. Examples: virus definition, vaccine manufactures etc. Value Sets are published in a single zip file that contains a Protocol Buffer message and signature.
- `business rules` - Contains the business rules for a Digital Green Certificate to be checked against. Rules are published in multiple zip files (depending on country and type). Each zip file contains a binary representation(CBOR encoding) of a JSON structure and signature.

### DCC Rule & Value Set Distribution Backend

- `https://distribution.dcc-rules.de`

### DCC Signature verification

X-SIGNATURE header is present on the Response headers of the DCC.
The signature is verified by using the ECDSA (elliptic curve encryption) algorithm using the public key and the body content.

The signature verification is done by [`DccSignatureValidator`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/dgc/client/signature/DccSignatureValidator.java).

### Value sets

A list containing all possible value sets(metadata) can be retrieved by calling `/valuesets` endpoint.
Then, each individual value set can be retrieved by calling `/valuesets/{hash}`

The [`DigitalGreenCertificateToProtobufMapping`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/dgc/DigitalGreenCertificateToProtobufMapping.java)
is responsible for reading the values, using the [`DistributionServiceConfig`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/config/DistributionServiceConfig.java) to get server/client configurations.

At the end of the process these URLs are created to allow retrieving the protobuf files: `ehn-dgc/{supportedLanguage}/value-sets`.

The supported languages are [configurable](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-server/blob/release/2.20/services/distribution/src/main/resources/application.yaml#L254), for now they are: de, en, bg, pl, ro, tr, uk.

For local testing the following value sets may be consumed:

- vaccine-prophylaxis.json - Vaccine or prophylaxis
- vaccine-medicinal-product.json - Vaccine medicinal product
- vaccine-mah-manf.json - Marketing Authorization Holder
- disease-agent-targeted.json - Disease or Agent Targeted
- test-manf.json - Rapid Antigen Test name and manufacturer
- test-result.json - Test Result
- test-type.json - Type of Test

They can be found in the [dgc folder](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-server/tree/5e47a2e485585043a05ec4173204dd020c757585/services/distribution/src/main/resources/dgc)

### Onboarded countries

A list containing all onboarded countries can be retrieved by calling `/countrylist` endpoint.
The country list is then CBOR encoded and distributed on CDN on the following path: `ehn-dgc/{supportedLanguage}/onboarded-countries`.

### Business rules

A list containing all possible business rules(metadata) can be retrieved by calling `/rules` endpoint.
Then, each individual business rule can be retrieved by calling `/rules/{countryCode}/{hash}`

The [`DigitalGreenCertificateToCborMapping`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/dgc/DigitalGreenCertificateToCborMapping.java)
is responsible for reading the values, encode them in CBOR format by using the [`DistributionServiceConfig`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/config/DistributionServiceConfig.java) to get server/client configurations.

All business rules are then divided into `acceptance` and `invalidation` rules, encoded in CBOR format and distributed on CDN on the following paths:

- acceptance rules: `ehn-dgc/acceptance-rules`.
- invalidation rules: `ehn-dgc/invalidation-rules`.

## Digital Signing Certificate

The signing certificates for Digital Covid Certificate are provided by IBM/Ubirch.

- Prod: `https://de.dscg.ubirch.com`
- Test: `https://de.test.dscg.ubirch.com`

### DSC Signature verification

For Digital Signing Certificate, the signature is present on the first line of the response body.

The response is returned as a String from the Feign Client [`DigitalSigningCertificatesFeignClient`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/dgc/dsc/DigitalSigningCertificatesFeignClient.java).
and processed by [`DscListDecoder`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/dgc/dsc/decode/DscListDecoder.java). The decoder splits the signature and the JSON format content and verifies the signature using the content and the public key.
The encryption algorithm is ECDSA.

The content part of the body is also checked to be a valid X509 certificate.

### CDN distribution

The resulting certificates list is converted to Protobuf format by [`DigitalSigningCertificatesToProtobufMapping`](/services/distribution/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/server/services/distribution/dgc/dsc/DigitalSigningCertificatesToProtobufMapping.java).

Digital Signing Certificates are distributed on CDN on the following path: `ehn-dgc/dscs`.

### Certificate Revocation

The revoked certificates are provided by IBM/Ubirch.

- Prod: `https://de.crl.dscg.ubirch.com`
- Test: `https://de.crl.test.dscg.ubirch.com`

## App Features

Starting with version 2.8 there is now the possibility to submit encrypted check-ins. For clients to check whether this feature is enabled on the cwa-server a new app feature [```EVREG_UNENCRYPTED_CHECKINS_ENABLED```](../services/distribution/src/main/resources/application.yaml) is introduced.

```yaml
    app-features:
      - label: unencrypted-checkins-enabled
        value: ${EVREG_UNENCRYPTED_CHECKINS_ENABLED:0}
```

### Additional Note

**Not to be confused** with [```UNENCRYPTED_CHECKINS_ENABLED```](../services/submission/src/main/resources/application.yaml) from the **submission service**, which indicates whether submission still accepts default check-ins or only accepts encrypted check-ins and is of type `Boolean`.
