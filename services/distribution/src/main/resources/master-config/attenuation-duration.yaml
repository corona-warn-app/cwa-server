# This is the attenuation and duration parameter thresholds. The lower and
# upper threshold partitions the value range into 3 subsets: low, mid, high
#
# Each of the aforementioned partitions has a weight in the range of [0, 1]
# assigned to it. The number of decimal places is restricted to 3.

thresholds:
  lower: 50
  upper: 70
weights:
