# Mappings below are intended to be used for encoding certain information in the DiagnosisKeys prior to 
# publishing on CDNs. These derivations/transformations have a different nature then the ones performed on incmoing TEKs
# because they are not persistent (stored keys are not affected).
transmission-risk-encoding:
# The following two mappings are intended for computations regarding the risk of infection done on the mobile client with
# Exposure Notification Framework v2 (enfv2). Transmission information will be encoded in the DSOS and RT (Report Type) 
# fields of the keys before distributing them.
# In essence transission risk involves a 2-step derivation logic between the time when a key entered the system (EFGS/submission) 
# and the time it gets published to CDN. First the TRL must be determined/derived from DSOS with the mappings defined above in the yaml,
# then we proceed to re-encode DSOS (with a different range of values) and RT from the derived TRL and those values are 
# published to CDNs for client consumption.
