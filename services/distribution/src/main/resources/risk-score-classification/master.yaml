# This is the Risk Score Classification master file which partitions the risk
# score value range (0-255) into distinct risk classes that will be used to by
# the app in order to present the correct risk classification in a user
# friendly manner, based on the underlying total risk score, to the user.
#
# The risk classes must not overlap and
# cover the full risk score value range (0-255).
#
# Change this file with caution!
